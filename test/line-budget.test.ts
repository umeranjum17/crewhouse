// crewd's src/ line budget, measured after the one-person migration and entry-point deletions.
// Every change from here keeps src/ net <= 0; raising BUDGET needs an owner decision, with deletions elsewhere first.
// Raised 6838 -> 6856 for the marketplace import feature (Main1094): the thin crew_import hook, the shared
// seat path and the soul-reset guard; fetch/parse/map/write live unbudgeted in scripts/. The dead-code hunt
// recorded in the firstmate home (data/ch-crew-templates/budget-note.md) found nothing honest to delete.
